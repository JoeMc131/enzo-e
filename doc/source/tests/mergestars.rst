Merge Stars Tests
------------------

Tests of the enzo-e "merge stars" method with a problem involving a collapsing sphere of particles. Runs "pm update" and "merge stars" method with parameters set in the parameter files merge_stars_test-1.in, merge_stars_test-8.in, and merge_stars_test-16.in, in the directory: input/MergeStars. The test suite simply runs the test problems and checks whether enzo-e exits without returning an error code. In order to get more useful output from the tests, it is recommended to look at input/MergeStars/README and following the instructions there.
