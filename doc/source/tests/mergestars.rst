Merge Stars Tests
------------------

Two tests of the enzo-e "merge stars" method (the serial test and the parallel test). All the files necessary for running the tests can be found in input/merge_stars.

These tests can be executed by running "ctest -R merge_stars_*" in the build directory.

See input/merge_stars/README for further information on these tests.
