# Problem: Axis aligned Shock Tube Dual Energy test problem for VLCT
# Author: Matthew Abruzzo (matthewabruzzo@gmail.com)

# Sod Shock Tube Test Problem along x-axis
# tests the dual energy formalism by using a background velocity-y component
# with a Mach number of ~10 (exact value was chosen to match the aligned_case)
