This directory contains various scripts and parameter files required to run the
merge stars test problem.

run.sh executes ics.py, which creates a particle data file that is used to create
the initial conditions in Enzo-E.

It then runs the test problem with 1, 8, and 16 processes.

It then runs images.py, which creates images showing the x and y coordinates
of star particles in the outputs generated by running the test problems.

Finally it runs mass_momentum_conservation.py, which produces a plot
showing the evolution of mass, momentum and particle number for each of the
test problems. This is useful for testing whether the star merging method
is conserving mass and momentum.

Running the python scripts requires creating a conda environment from
environment.yml (see https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file for
instructions).

run.sh requires the environment variables ENZO_E_HOME and CHARM_HOME to be set
to paths where bin/enzo-e and bin/charmrun can be found, respectively.
